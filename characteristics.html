<h1>Characterstics of Internet of things</h1>

<div>
<ol>
<li>Intelligence</li>
<p>IoT comes with the combination of computing and algorithms, software & 
hardware that makes it smart. Ambient intelligence in IoT improves its
 capabilities to enable the stuff to respond to a particular situation 
 in an intelligent way and to assist them in performing specific tasks. 
 Despite all the popularity of smart technologies, IoT intelligence is
 concerned only with device interaction, while user and device interaction
 is achieved through standard input methods and the graphical user interface</p>
 <li> Connectivity</li>
 <p>Connectivity empowers the Internet of Things by putting the everyday objects together.
 Connectivity of these objects is crucial because basic interactions at object level lead 
 to collective knowledge in the IoT network. It enables transparency and usability of networks
 in matters. With this connection, the networking of smart devices and applications will build
 new business opportunities for the Internet of Stuffs.</p>
 <li>Security</li>
 <p>IoT devices are naturally vulnerable to security threats. As we gain efficiencies,
 novel experiences, and other benefits from the IoT, it would be a mistake to forget 
 about security concerns associated with it. There is a high level of transparency and 
 privacy issues with IoT. It is important to secure the endpoints, the networks, and the
 data that is transferred across all of it means creating a security paradigm.</p>
 <li>Dynamic Nature</li>
 <p>The primary Internet of Things operation is to gather data from its surroundings,
 this is achieved with the complex changes taking place around the apps. The state of
 these devices dynamically varies, such as sleeping and waking up, connected and/or
 disconnected, and the context of the devices including temperature, location and speed</p>
 <li>Enormous scale</li>
 <p>The number of devices that need to be managed and that communicate with each other 
 will be much larger than the devices connected to the current Internet. The management
 of data generated from these devices and their interpretation for application purposes
 becomes more critical. Gartner (2015) confirms the enormous scale of IoT in the estimated 
 report where it stated that 5.5 million new things will get connected every day and 6.4
 billion connected things will be in use worldwide in 2016, which is up by 30 percent from
 2015. The report also forecasts that the number of connected devices will reach 20.8 billion by 2020.</p>
