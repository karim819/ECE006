<ol>
<li>Information Access</li>
<p>You can easily access data and information that are sitting far
 from your location, in real time. This is possible because of the
 network of devices, a person can access any information sitting
 from any part of the globe. This makes it very convenient for people
 to go about their work, even if they are not physically present</p>
 <li>Communication</li>
 <p>Better communication via a network of interconnected devices is possible,
 making it more transparent, which reduces inefficiencies. Processes, where 
 computers must interact with each other, are much more effective and produce better,
 quicker performance. A machinery in a manufacturing or processing facility is the ideal example for this</p>
 <li>Cost-Effective</li>
 <p>communication between electronic devices is made easier because of IoT. 
 This helps people in daily tasks. Transferring data packets over a connected 
 network save time and money. The same data that would take a long time to 
 transfer can now be done much faster, thanks to IoT</p>
 <li>Automation</li>
 <p>Automation is the hour-need to perform everyday activities without 
 human intervention. Automating business processes helps improve the 
 efficiency of the services and lower the level of human interaction.</p>

<li>Privacy & Security</li>
<p>N The tech-driven world of today, any computer that an person uses is 
connected through the internet. It raises the likelihood of any data leakage
 which could be important. It is a significant downside to exchanging information, 
 because sensitive information could not be secure and may easily be accessed by third parties.</p>
 <li>Lesser Jobs</li>
 <p>With every task being automated, the need for human labour will reduce drastically.
 This will have a direct impact on employability. As we head into the future of IoT, 
 there will be a visible decline in the hiring process of professionals</p>
 <li>Complexity</li>
 <p>What we call IoT is a diverse network which connects different devices. 
 A single loophole may impact the entire program. It is by far the most complex 
 component of things on the internet and can have a huge impact.</p>
 <li>Dependability</li>
 <p>There is no doubt that technology is dominating our lifestyle,
 reflecting human dependability on technology. In case of a bug in the
 system, there are high chances of every related device getting corrupted.</p>
