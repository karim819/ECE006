<h1>The basic elements of IOT</h1>
<img style="width:100%; height:400px; margin-top:-21px" src="e.jpg">
<div>
<p>In a nutshell, the Internet of Things is the concept of connecting 
any device to the Internet and to other connected devices. The IoT is 
a giant network of connected things and people – all of which collect
 and share data about the way they are used and about the environment around them.</p>
 <ol>
 <li> Connected devices</li>
 <p>Devices are the principal physical objects that are related to the device. 
 For Asset Control Systems, sensors are the communication layer components of 
 the computer. These smart sensors continuously collect environmental data and 
 forward the information to the next layer.The new half-conductor manufacturing 
 techniques are capable of developing micro-smart sensors for different applications.</p>
 <li>Central Control Hardware</li>
 <p>A Control Panel handles data traffic between various networks and protocols 
 in two ways. Another control panel feature is to translate various network protocols 
 and to make sure the connected devices and sensors are interoperable.</p>
 <img style="width:100%; height:400px; " src="2.png">
 <li>Data Cloud</li>
 <p>Internet of things creates massive data from devices, applications and users which has 
 to be managed in an efficient way. IoT cloud offers tools to collect, process, manage and 
 store huge amount of data in real time. Industries and services can easily access these 
 data remotely and make critical decisions when necessary.<br> Basically,
 IoT cloud is a sophisticated high-performance network of servers optimized 
 to perform high-speed data processing of myriads of devices, traffic
 management and deliver accurate data analysis. Distributed management 
 database systems are one of the indispensable components of IoT cloud</p>
 <li>User interface</li>
 <p>User interfaces are the visible, tangible part of the IoT system which can be
 accessible by users. Designers will have to make sure a well-designed user interface
 for minimum effort for users and encourage more interactions.<br>
 User interface design has higher significance in today’s competitive
 market; it often determines the user whether to choose a particular 
 device or appliance. Users will be interested in buying new devices 
 or smart gadgets if it is very user-friendly and compatible with common
 connectivity standards.</p>
 <li>Network Interconnection</li>
 <p>The IoT’s major significant trend in recent years is the explosive 
 growth of devices connected and controlled by the internet. The wide
 range of applications for IoT technology means that the specifics can 
 be very different from one device to the next, but there are basic 
 characteristics shared by most.<br>There are many technologies that 
 enable IoT. Crucial to the field is the network used to communicate 
 between devices of an IoT installation, a role that several wireless 
 or wired technologies may fulfil.</p>
 <li>System Security</li>
 <p>Security is a critical element of IoT deployment, yet it is too often neglected
 in the development of systems. Everyday vulnerabilities in IoT are being exploited
 with malicious intent – yet the vast majority of them can be prevented simply
 and cost-effectively.<br>A secure system starts with the practice of 
 eradicating vulnerabilities in IoT devices and equipping them with the
 means to resist, detect and recover from malicious attacks.</p>
 <li>Data Analytics</li>
 <p>Analytics is the process of converting analogue data from interconnected smart 
 devices and sensors into usable insights that can be processed, interpreted and
 used for detailed analysis. Intelligent analytics are inevitable for IoT
 technology for management and improvement of the entire system.<br>One
 of the utmost advantages of an efficient IoT system is real-time smart 
 analytics which helps engineers to find out irregularities in the collected 
 data and act fast to prevent an undesired scenario. Service providers can 
 prepare for further steps if the information is collected accurately at the right time.</p>
